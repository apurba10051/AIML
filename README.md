**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Proof of Concept (PoC)**
üöß This project is developed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) and is intended for demonstration and experimentation purposes only.

While the current implementation focuses on showcasing the clinical trial ingestion, enrichment, AI scoring, it is not yet optimized for production-scale workloads.

----
## üß™ Problem Statement
Clinical trials face several critical challenges:   

‚è≥ Slow Patient Recruitment: Matching patients to strict eligibility criteria delays trial timelines.    
‚ùå High Failure Rates: Many trials fail to show efficacy/safety despite high investments.    
üìâ Poor Trial Designs: Flawed inclusion criteria or sample sizes undermine statistical validity.    
üîó Data Silos: Difficulty integrating fragmented data (e.g., EHRs, registries) hinders insights.    
‚ö†Ô∏è Complex Outcome Prediction: Traditional methods struggle to model trial success due to multi-factorial dependencies.    

##  üí° Expected outcome
Our Clinical Trial Prediction System addresses these issues using -     
üìä Machine Learning: Predicts trial outcomes using historical data (design, interventions, demographics).    
üß† NLP Techniques: Converts unstructured text (e.g., eligibility criteria) into structured, analyzable data.    
üìà Predictive Insights: Supports smarter trial design, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.    
üéØ Enables researchers, sponsors, and clinicians to make data-driven decisions, reducing costs and improving trial success rates.

## üöÄ Overview

Every day, clinical trial data is pulled incrementally from public **Clinical Trial APIs** or from private **CTMS (Clinical Trial Management systems)** via a batch or streaming ETL process or API ingestion. The data is enriched with final status updates and additional insights captured by **CROs (Contract Research Organizations)**, enhancing both the **data completeness** and **clinical relevance**.

An integrated AI/ML layer scores each trial record using modern machine learning and deep neural networks. The enriched, intelligent data is then sent to **Salesforce**, where **care coordinators** use it to match patients based on:

- üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Patient **Symptoms**, **Age** and **Gender**
- üìç Patient **Location**

###  üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Use Case Example 
A 65-year-old male patient with chronic back pain located in NYC is inquiring into this fictitious  system to find a suitable matching trial.     

#### Using the platform, the care coordinator:   
ü©∫ Inputs patient demographics and symptoms.    
üè• Views recommended clinical trials near the patient‚Äôs location.     
üß¨ Reviews AI-predicted match scores and detailed CRO enrichment (e.g., dropout rates, adverse events).         
üìÑ Selects and initiates the enrollment process for the top-ranked trial.      

## üß™ Clinical Trial Data Enrichment & Recommendation Platform             

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline that automates **clinical trial ingestion, enrichment, prediction** and delivery to the User Interface.   
While this project is primarily designed for integration with Salesforce  Cloud (where care coordinators interact with enriched clinical trial data), a lightweight UI using Streamlit or Flask is provided for local testing and demonstration purposes.         
This allows users to interact with the AI model and view predictions without requiring a Salesforce setup.      
The Streamlit/Flask interface serves as a functional prototype and can be extended or replaced by a Salesforce UI in production deployments.

## üîÑ Data Flow Architecture

This project follows a modular, end-to-end pipeline designed to ingest raw clinical trial data, process and clean it, engineer relevant features, train an explainable machine learning model, and prepare the system for deployment. The following components and architectural flow describe how each stage connects and contributes to the overall pipeline:
